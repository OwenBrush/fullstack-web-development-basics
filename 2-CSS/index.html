            <h2>Style</h2>
            <p>CSS brings style to a webpage - it brings color, margins, spacing, alignment, fonts, and other aesthetic qualities to a website.  These features can help build a user experience that is pleasant, clear, and intuitive.</p>

            <h2>Consistency</h2>
            <p>By using tag and class selectors CSS helps create consistency through a webpage, allowing us to define repeatable sets of style that are applied consistently to different elements of the page</p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>While it is possible to write css directly into an html file, it's better to have all styling contained within seperate css files in order to keep the code seperate and organized.  This allows us to alter the look of an entire site by altering just a single line of code.</p>

            <h2>Responsive</h2>
            <p>CSS can be made dynamic, so that the layout changes according to how it is being viewed, allowing the webpage to look good no matter how it is being accessed, whether it is full screen on a desktop, or through an iphone.</p>
